Good lord, this is three year old code that probably won't compile for a website that isn't in use anymore.  please don't use it, star it, read it, or otherwise pay any attention to it.

This is the source code for GopherTimes.com - a community website for the Go programming language.

Go is probably someone's trademark - maybe even Google's.  

This code isn't exactly beautiful yet, I'm focusing on large swaths of functionality before refactoring into attractive code to be proud of.  Patches and pull requests always welcome.

GopherTimes uses the following technologies:

* [twister](https://github.com/garyburd/twister) Wicked fast Go web server written by Gary Burd
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org)  
* [mgo](http://www.labix.org/mgo) MongoDB drivers for Go by Gustavo Niemeyer (and others?)
* [markdown](https://github.com/knieriem/markdown) Markdown for Go

*RSS feeds - done but with no sensible limits yet
*Twitter stream of #golang tweets
